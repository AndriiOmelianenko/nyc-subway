GeoJSON is a format for encoding geographic data structures, like the Subway Stations in NYC. GeoJSON has been standardized in an Internet Engineering Task Force standard called RFC7946. GeoJSON is defined in terms of JSON, JavaScript Object Notation, which itself was standardised in ECMA-404, by the same organization that standardized JavaScript, Ecma International.

NYC Open Data makes the wealth of public data generated by various New York City agencies and other City organizations available for public use. In this lab, you'll visualize the Subway Station and Subway Line data sets.
